Description: DESCRIPTION:
        ===========
        turtle_comments.py provides the user with several functions that draw different types of figures:
        
        * a square with "carre(animal,size)" 
        * several squares with "petitscarres(animal,n,size)"
        * concentric squares with "carresconc(animal,n,size)"
        * a n-gon with "draw_poly(animal,n,sz)"
        * a star with "bigstar(animal,n,size)"
        * a spiral with "spiral(animal,n,angle,size,space)"
        
        turtle_comments.py is written in Python3 and each of these functions require the turtle library.

        Q - Can I draw a rectangle?
        A - Unfortunately, no.
